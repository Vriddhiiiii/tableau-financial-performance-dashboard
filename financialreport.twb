🏢 Business Problem
Modern businesses struggle to understand how discount strategies, customer segments, and product performance affect overall financial health. Traditional reporting methods often fail to provide:
Real-time insights into profitability
Comparisons across multiple regions and products
Clear visibility on the impact of discounts on sales vs. profit
A single view that combines KPI tracking, trend analysis, and segmentation

This dashboard solves the problem by:
Consolidating critical metrics into a single interactive view
Allowing stakeholders to drill down into details by country, segment, and product
Revealing hidden patterns such as seasonal trends and discount effects
Empowering management with data-driven strategies for growth and cost optimization
✅ This structured format shows effort, clarity, and professionalism — perfect for GitHub and LinkedIn.
Would you like me to also design a ready-to-use README.md file (with proper Markdown styling, emojis, and sections) so you can copy-paste it directly into your repository?
